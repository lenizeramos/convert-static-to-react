# Convert STATIC to REACT assignment

## Objective

You are given a static project that you have to convert to a modern ***React + Vite - Single Page Application***. 

## Get Started 

```bash
index.html
```

In the project you will find a `index.html`, you can run it with a live server of your choice. 

__Essentially you are expected to develop a minimum/similar standard similar to this__. However you may improve upon it BUT the following requirements need to be fulfilled: 

## Requirements for this project. 

* Fix the Navbar, such that when clicked, it will redirect to the specific section within the website.
    * BONUS to have redirect to other urls, ex `/about` or `/work`

* All data should from root Component( App.js) or one single file (like `data.json`)

* ***Response*** to web + mobile + tablet

* Your app should be organized into accurate folder structures like `components`, `styles` or modularized components

* You may use any animation or utility libraries that you may deem suitable but, make sure they are not deprecated or are still maintained. 


## Submission

* You can work individually, or in pairs. 
    * Even if you work in pairs, both persons need to individually push their code to github.
