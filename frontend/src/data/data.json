      "鄧志浩，祖籍廣東，1954年生於台灣。",
      "藝術創作橫跨美術、音樂、戲劇等專業領域。",
      "個人風格鮮明的抽象畫畫家、民歌手、兒童戲劇導演、編劇、演員、作家、創意課程講師、手作木工、民宿餐廳經營者，是個多元發展的藝術家。",
      "1995年因緣際會師承新加坡抽象畫大師黃意會，自此開啟其抽象畫創作人生。",
      "鄧志浩因其豐富多元的創作背景，內化厚實的生活底蘊，使其作品呈現靜謐、精妙、純淨、優雅，生命力度盈沛飽滿的意境。",
      "『框外世界才是創作的理由』是鄧志浩創作的最佳註解！",
      "Originating from Guangdong, born in 1954 in Taiwan. Calvin Chih-Hao Teng started as a self-taught painter.",
      "For Calvin, life has always been exploring deep into the vast unknown. Throughout his artistic career, he has ventured into the fields of folk song singer and songwriter, author, to managing his own restaurant. Calvin has also respectfully dedicated 30 years perfecting his craft in children's theater as a director, playwright, and actor.",
      "During his travels in 1995, Calvin was fortunate to encounter a master painter from Singapore. Under his guidance, Calvin found his love and passion for abstract painting, a world he was previously unacquainted with. In time, Calvin ultimately shifted his paradigm from composing realism to abstract.",
      "Each painting imbues elements from all realms Calvin has walked upon through his journey of life. The audience is drawn in by wandering thoughts as each composition emotionally unites them with grace, purifying and rejuvenating the soul. Calvin has concluded art is an entity that propels him onward allowing him to pursue peace of mind."

I think Calvin’s work achieves great combination of the tradition of ink painting and landscape painting on Song Dynasty in China and the abstract expressionism on modern and contemporary Western Society. I have never seen that kind of artwork in Japan and in museums from around the world.",

          "中國知名藝評家 卜賀",
          "In his work, Mr. Calvin Teng has gotten rid of the restrains of forms; he sought after the subtlety beyond the imagery. In the painting, we could see images of clouds and water surging and flowing, which capture the essence of Chinese paintings. With a combination of various media and oil paints, Teng expresses the notion of unity of heaven and mankind, and a virtual yet serene state where one becomes oblivious of the self – a concept that is unique to Chinese philosophy. What amazes us more is that as a former musician, he transformed auditory notes into visual images. To our surprise, he “painted out” melody, rhythm, harmony, polyphony, tonality, and musical form, which were elements that could only be expressed through sounds.",

Through creating landscape art, Calvin spawns metaphors to resemble the harmonious and solemn beauty of the earth. His artwork contains passionate, poetic and philosophical essence, which epitomizes Mother Nature and will stand as a divine force with the passage of time.",
